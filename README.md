Project Akrasia is a game made by the Game Development team of the 3rd Year of Computer Engineering at Estgoh called Spaghetty Arts.
This repositorie is a compilation of all plugins created by us during the development of the game. They are represented by **!SPA (Plugins made by Afonso), !SPF (Plugins Made by Fabian), !SPH(Plugins made by Hugo)**
Some plugins can be adapted for any game, some are specific to our game, however we think they are a great way to understand MV engine a bit more.
